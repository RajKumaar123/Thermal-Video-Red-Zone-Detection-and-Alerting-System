# Thermal-Video-Red-Zone-Detection-and-Alerting-System
This project checks thermal or surveillance videos to find areas with too much red color, which can mean heat or fire. It marks those areas, saves alert times, and shows a graph of how red changes over time. Useful for safety checks and spotting problems early.
